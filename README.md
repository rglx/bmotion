# bMotion

An "Artificial stupidity" plugin for eggdrop, with support for factoids, and annoying entire channels at once quickly.

## this is a FORK!

this is a fork of the original bmotion, intended to possibly go a separate direction with the core ideas of the code. you have been warned. 

this fork maintained by [rglx](<../../../../rglx/>).

## [contributions welcome](<../../issues>)

especially revolving around some of the plugins and abstracts that are ... let's just say "dated"

Thanks for trying out bMotion!

You can also get limited assistance from #bmotion on EFNet -- note
I do this in my spare time so if I'm not around to help, don't take
it personally :) Perhaps a community of other people who can help
will spring up.

The official home for documentation is now

Have fun!
